**Research question**

Has direct democracy an effect on satisfaction with the way democracy works?

**Theory**

Easton, Fuchs, etc. -> political support

**Hypotheses**

H1: Direct democracy has a positive effect on individual satisfaction with democracy.

H2: The H1-effect is moderated by...

1. political apathy (Operationalization -> voters (compared to non-voters), problem: occasional voters can not be separated)
2. socio-economic status/income
3. political interest (problem: might be influenced by DD & ambiguously related to SWD -> "assertive citizens"") 
4. party identification
